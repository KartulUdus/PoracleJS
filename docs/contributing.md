# Contributing to PoracleJS

## I need help
Best place to get your questions answered is our [discord](https://discord.gg/WDMr8xX).   
Should that not succeed in solving your problem, you're also welcome to [raise an issue on github](https://github.com/KartulUdus/PoracleJS/issues).  

## How do I get started contributing?

The project has its own developer dependencies that are automatically installed along with `npm i`.    
It includes packages to run the [wiki](https://kartuludus.github.io/PoracleJS/#/) and check your code against the project [style guide](https://github.com/KartulUdus/PoracleJS/blob/master/.eslintrc.json)  

Linting rules will be checked automatically by travis; however, should you wish to save some time, you can run the check locally by running:  
`npm run lint` (please note,  Windows users may have to run `node_modules\.bin\eslint app\src` manually)
